    <main><p class="first-paragraph">Reflecting on my experiences and how they shape my future career goals, I am proud to share that my life has continuously shaped who I am today. Every encounter I have faced in my life has encouraged me to remain curious and passionate.</p>
        <p>I started my university studies with a film and digital media focus, learning all of the aspects that make a film work. I was taught to pay close attention to the the technical details, such as cinematography, lighting, sound design, screenwriting, and editing. This made me a very detail-oriented person. Alongside these things, I learned that it was not only the technical parts that make a decent film but how the story engages the audience emotionally. I learned to work as part of a film team and modify what I know to better support my group. I got to work with actors and analyze films that changed my perception of the depth of authentic performance.</p>
        <P>As I transitioned into a broader area of study, digital storytelling, my previous learnings were once again prevalent. My experiences in film studies provided me with a strong foundation of skills. My first production class in my new environment was unlike anything I had experienced before. There was no set structure telling me how something was done. I was presented with complete artistic freedom. This changed the outlook I previously had on conventional Filmmaking. I was pushed out of my comfort zone and had to navigate this on my own. I have created numerous projects with trial and error. Each progressed with constructive critiques in class, shaping who I am as a storyteller.</P>
        <p>Looking forward, I am determined to use my skills in the working field, whether it is to create meaningful media that engages audiences or to work for a company that strives to inspire and engage its audiences. However, I am not tied down to one concept of work. I am always looking to push my boundaries and use my creativity to pursue any position that is deemed appropriate.</p>
