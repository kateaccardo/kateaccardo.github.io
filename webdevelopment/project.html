            <h2>Message in a Bottle, A Short Film</h2>

            <p>This is a short film that I made that challenged me to develop a unique personal style and voice for storytelling, inspired by the concept of Auteur Filmmaking. The narrative is as follows: After the end of a profound love, a young woman writes a letter and throws it into the ocean as an attempt at closure. Later, the letter returns as a rewrite and she is left at peace with the acceptance of not knowing. The film explores the idea of love beyond endings. The rewrite of the letter implies uncertainty. It is better to hold on to the good memories. To let go, but not reminisce. The film speaks to the universal experience of love and loss. I wanted to portray that notion with room for interpretation. This is a story for everyone. At some point or another, we lose something in life whether it be love or not.</p>

            <p>As a part of our class project, our film team was meant to film a short brand narrative for the Six-Mile-Ordinary local distillery in Columbia, MO. The commercial-style film follows the narrative of a woman who is living a fast-paced, busy work life that is ultimately rewarded with the atmosphere of the distillery. Our film’s primary focus was a drink called Alan’s Old Fashioned. Highlighting the essence of the drink. As part of my crew, I was assigned to be assistant camera and lighting. We each got to edit our versions, to bring a more personal voice and style to the piece.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Stamps, An Unnoticed Narrative</h2>
            <div class="project-container">
            <video src="UnnoticedNarrative4.11.25(1).mp4" controls width="500" poster="Stamps.jpg"></video>
            <div class="reflection-box"> 
            <p>This is a short film that explores the untold story of stamps, encouraging the audience to see a stamp as something other than a piece of paper that symbolizes payment. My film highlights how a person’s choice of stamps reflects their personality, whether they realize it or not. Every decision is intentional. The film features people in my life and based on their personality, or letters I have received from them, I selected corresponding stamps. My film aids in taking a unique perspective to give a voice to something that is often overlooked. It prompts the audience to take a closer look at other small, meaningful details in their lives.</p>
